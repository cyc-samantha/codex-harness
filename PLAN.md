# Codex-Harness Port Plan


Porting the Claude Code harness at `/home/samanthachen/git/.claude` (skills, agent
team, enforcement hooks, memory/recall, continuous learning, internal eval) onto
OpenAI Codex CLI.


**Verified against Codex CLI documentation as of 2026-07-09** (`developers.openai.com/codex/*`,
mirrored from `github.com/openai/codex/docs/*`). Every capability claim below is
either (a) cited to a specific doc page fetched during this planning pass, or
(b) explicitly marked `<unverified>` where the doc set did not confirm behavior.
Do not treat `<unverified>` items as blocking — they are flagged for a follow-up
manual probe (CX-90, Phase 6) before the harness depends on them.


**Headline finding that revises the brief's assumed shape**: Codex CLI in
mid-2026 ships native equivalents for three primitives the origin brief assumed
would need heavy substitution — **Skills** (`.agents/skills/SKILL.md`,
progressive disclosure, near byte-identical contract to Claude's Skill tool),
**Subagents** (`agents.<name>` TOML config + `/agent` CLI switching + parallel
dispatch), and **Hooks** (`hooks.json` with `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/
`SessionStart`/`SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`/`Stop`/`PreCompact`/`PostCompact`/
`UserPromptSubmit`/`PermissionRequest` events, `command`-type handlers). This
plan ports against that reality rather than the heavier substitution ladder
(prompts-as-skills, `codex exec`-as-orchestration, git-hooks-as-enforcement)
that would be needed on an older Codex CLI. Where Codex's native primitive is
narrower than Claude's, the gap is called out per-row in the capability table.

## 1. Executive Summary


**Goal**: reproduce, on Codex CLI, as much of the Claude harness's engineering
discipline as the platform supports — Iron Laws, pipeline phase gating,
skills/agents, worktree isolation, memory/recall, continuous learning, internal
eval — while being honest about what cannot port at all.


**What ports at (near-)FULL fidelity**:
- Skills — Codex's `.agents/skills/SKILL.md` format is structurally the same
  contract as Claude's Skill tool (name + description frontmatter, progressive
  disclosure, optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`). The ~75-skill
  catalog ports as a skill directory tree with no format rewrite needed.
- AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md autoload — Codex's own native mechanism (global →
  project-root → nested, `AGENTS.override.md` precedence). This is *more*
  capable than Claude's single-file `CLAUDE.md` + `rules/core.md` combo, so
  the merged `AGENTS.md` in this repo is a straight port, not a substitute.
- Memory/recall/learning/eval — `memory.sqlite`, `observations.jsonl`,
  `reindex-memory`, `recall`, `mcp_memory` (stdio JSON-RPC server) are Python
  stdlib scripts with zero dependency on which coding agent invokes them. They
  port byte-for-byte; only the *caller* (Codex hook / prompt) changes.
- Pipeline state (`pipeline-state/{task-id}/*.md`) — plain markdown with YAML
  frontmatter. Portable verbatim; a task begun under Claude can resume under
  Codex and vice versa if both harnesses point at the same `HARNESS_DATA` dir.


**What needs re-architecture**:
- Agent Team / parallel dispatch — Codex's `agents.<name>` TOML files are a
  weaker primitive than Claude's per-role `agents/*.md` (no per-agent
  `tools:` allowlist enforcement, no `isolation: "worktree"` frontmatter field,
  `agents.max_depth` defaults to 1 vs Claude's configurable depth-3). The
  orchestration script layer (Phase 2, CX-20 through CX-27) closes this gap by
  wrapping `codex exec --profile <role>` invocations with the worktree-creation
  and tool-scoping logic Codex doesn't do natively.
- Verdict gating / phase advancement — Codex has no concept of a "pipeline
  phase verdict gate." This is pure orchestration-script logic (bash/Python
  driving `codex exec` in sequence, parsing `--output-schema` JSON for the
  verdict field) — there is no native primitive to lean on at all.
- Mutation-semantic hook injection (Claude's `instinct-injector.sh` splicing a
  `## Learned Patterns` block into a spawn prompt) — Codex hooks today only
  run `type: "command"` handlers; `prompt` and `agent` handler types are
  *parsed but skipped* (verified, `codex/hooks` doc). There is no confirmed
  `modified_tool_input`-equivalent on any Codex hook event. The orchestration
  script must inject instincts/session-memory/scratchpad by literally
  concatenating them into the prompt string it hands to `codex exec`, mirroring
  what the Claude harness's orchestrator already does at the application layer
  (per `protocols/autonomous-intelligence.md` — the orchestrator splice, not
  the hook, does the injection there too). Net effect: this actually ports at
  **FULL** fidelity, because the source harness's real mechanism was always
  orchestrator-side string concatenation, not a hook mutation.


**What is impossible (or not worth attempting) on Codex today**:
- Per-agent enforced tool allowlists (Claude's `pre-agent-allowlist.sh`,
  ENFORCING since 2026-05-14) — Codex's `agents.<name>` config has no
  `tools:` allowlist / deny-list field in the verified doc set. `<unverified>`
  whether `mcp_servers` scoping per agent role can approximate this; flagged
  for CX-90 probe. Until then: DROPPED, replaced by an AGENTS.md-level
  admonition (advisory only).
- True mid-session `PreToolUse` *blocking* on non-command hook types (the
  Claude harness's `exit 2` semantics) is confirmed to work for `command`
  hooks on Codex (`hooks.json`), so this is NOT impossible — see the
  Hooks Substitution Ladder in §3. What IS impossible: Claude's
  `modified_tool_input` patch-in-place semantics used by advisory Path-B
  hooks (`instinct-injector.sh`, `pre-agent-thinking.sh`) — Codex has no
  documented equivalent. These stay orchestration-script-side (see above).
- `Computer` tool parity for `vlm-critic` / `design-qc` screenshot-diff
  work — `<unverified>`; Codex's tool surface for vision/computer-use was not
  confirmed in the fetched doc set. Marked DROPPED pending a dedicated probe;
  not a Phase 0-5 blocker.

### Runtime model


1. **Human or CI invokes `scripts/codex-harness <command>`** (e.g. `pipeline start <task-id>`, `pipeline resume <task-id>`
2. **The orchestration script is the orchestrator.** It never writes source code
   itself (Iron Law 3 substitute — see §4). It only:
   - creates/removes git worktrees,
   - assembles prompts (skill body + agent role file + instincts + session
     memory + scratchpad + prior phase's `## Next Phase Input`),
   - invokes `codex exec --profile <role> --cd <worktree> --sandbox
     workspace-write --output-schema <phase-verdict-schema.json> "<assembled prompt>"`,
   - parses the verdict JSON, writes `pipeline-state/{task-id}/{phase}.md`,
   - decides the next phase per the same phase order as the Claude harness.
3. **Skills are read by Codex itself**, not re-implemented by the script — once
   a `codex exec` invocation is scoped to a worktree with `.agents/skills/`
   visible (repo-root scope), Codex's own skill-selection logic (implicit
   description-match, or explicit `$skill-name` mention in the assembled
   prompt) picks up the ported `SKILL.md` files exactly as it would any other
   skill. The orchestration script's job is to *mention* the right skill by
   name in the prompt it assembles (mirroring how the Claude orchestrator's
   spawn prompt says "Read `~/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`").
4. **Subagent parallelism**: Best-of-N and multi-slice Build dispatch become N
   parallel `codex exec` invocations, one per worktree, backgrounded by the
   orchestration script (`&` + `wait`), exactly mirroring the Claude harness's
   "parallel subagent calls in a single message" default dispatch mode (no
   `TeamCreate`/tmux-pane equivalent is needed — Codex has no visible-team
   concept; every dispatch is the parallel-subagent default, never the
   opt-in visible-team mode).
5. **Hooks fire natively inside each `codex exec` invocation** — the code-shape
   checker, main-branch guard, and observation-capture hooks are registered
   once in `.codex/hooks.json` and apply to every spawned agent without the
   orchestration script re-wiring them per call.


### Key design moves (detail)


#### Skills → Codex native Skills (not a prompt substitute)


Because Codex Skills already implement progressive disclosure
(`codex/skills`: *"Codex starts with each skill's name, description, and file
path. Codex loads the full SKILL.md instructions only when it decides to use a
skill."*), the ~75 harness `skills/*/SKILL.md` files port with **no format
change** — copy the directory, keep frontmatter, done. The install step is a
placement decision only: which of the five discovery scopes (REPO `$CWD/.agents/skills`,
REPO parent, REPO root, USER `$HOME/.agents/skills`, ADMIN `/etc/codex/skills`)
each skill belongs in. Harness-wide skills (pipeline, intake, build-implementation,
learn) go in REPO ROOT scope so every subfolder of a checked-out project inherits
them; project-specific overrides would go in nested REPO scopes (not needed for
Phase 0-5).


One real constraint: Codex's skill-selection budget caps the *initial* skill
list at "2% of the model's context window, or 8,000 characters when the
context window is unknown" (verified `codex/skills`) — with ~75 skills, harness
skill *descriptions* must stay terse (front-load the trigger words) or Codex
will shorten them further / omit some from the initial list. Phase 1 (CX-10)
includes a description-length audit pass for this reason.


#### Subagent team → `agents.<name>` TOML + orchestration wrapper


Each Claude `agents/<role>.md` becomes a `.codex/agents/<role>.toml` with the
three REQUIRED fields (`name`, `description`, `developer_instructions`) plus
optional `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `sandbox_mode`. The
`developer_instructions` field is where the ported agent role-definition body
(TDD protocol, decision ladder, self-review checklist) lives verbatim.
`skills.config` in the TOML can pre-enable/disable specific skills per role,
approximating (loosely) Claude's per-agent `tools:` allowlist for the *skill*
surface — it does NOT approximate the `tools:` allowlist for raw tool access
(Bash/Write/Edit/etc.), which has no confirmed per-role gate on Codex today
(see §2 DROPPED row).


Parallel dispatch = parallel `codex exec` processes, each with its own
`--cd <worktree>`; worktree isolation = the orchestration script's
`dispatch-agent.sh` running plain `git worktree add` before each invocation
(the CLI has no first-class isolation flag for this — the automatic
"Worktree" UI feature is scoped to the ChatGPT desktop app only, confirmed
above). This is intentionally identical in shape to how the Claude harness's
`hooks/worktree-create.sh` already works — Codex just doesn't do it for you.


#### Hooks → substitution ladder (revised: native hooks cover more than expected)


1. **Native `command`-type `hooks.json` entries** — for every Claude hook that
   is a deterministic exit-2-on-violation check (shape rules, protected-path
   checks, destructive-verb detection), port the shell script body unchanged
   and register it under the matching Codex event name. Confirmed available
   events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `SubagentStart`,
   `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
   `PermissionRequest`, `Stop` (verified `codex/hooks`).
2. **`.rules` / `prefix_rule` for command-level allow/forbid** — the
   Non-LLM Gate on destructive verbs (Iron Law 4 companion) ports as
   `prefix_rule(pattern=[...], decision="forbidden")` entries. Marked
   experimental by OpenAI — do not treat as load-bearing until it stabilizes
   past the "may change" warning on the doc page.
3. **CI checks** — anything that needs a second, independent verification pass
   (mutation-score gating, EVAL_PASSED gate) runs as a GitHub Action step
   invoking `codex exec` non-interactively, mirroring the Claude harness's
   Internal Eval Gate.
4. **`sandbox_mode` / `approval_policy`** as the permission layer — `codex exec`
   defaults to `read-only`; the orchestration script explicitly requests
   `workspace-write` per Build-phase invocation and never `danger-full-access`
   outside a documented isolated runner (per the doc's own warning, mirrored
   verbatim into AGENTS.md).
5. **What does NOT port**: mutation-semantic hooks that patch the spawn prompt
   in place (`instinct-injector.sh`, `pre-agent-thinking.sh`,
   `cache-breakpoint-injector.sh`). Codex hooks parse but skip `prompt`/`agent`
   handler types (verified) and there is no confirmed `modified_tool_input`
   equivalent. These become orchestration-script string concatenation instead
   — which, as noted in §1, is actually what the Claude harness does today too
   (the hook there is advisory/log-only; the real splice is orchestrator-side).


Iron-Law enforcement-status downgrade table is in §4.


#### Memory/recall port (FULL fidelity)


`memory.sqlite` + `observations.jsonl` + `reindex-memory` + `recall` (3-tier
progressive disclosure: search / timeline / hydrate) + `mcp_memory` (stdio
JSON-RPC server) are pure Python stdlib. Register the server verbatim:


```toml
[mcp_servers.memory]
command = "python3"
args = ["$CODEX_HOME/harness-data/mcp_memory/server.py"]
required = true
```


`required = true` means `codex exec` exits with an error if the memory server
fails to start — the codex-harness equivalent of Claude's fail-closed posture
for a broken memory index (Iron Law 8 spirit).


#### Learning loop port


`observations.jsonl` → `/harness-learn` (ported skill, same 10-step procedure:
pattern detection, anti-pattern mining, sandbox-fragility mining, instinct
creation/pruning/promotion, memory-promotion drafts) → instinct files under
`learning/{project-hash}/instincts/*.md`, unchanged schema. Instinct injection
substitute: the orchestration script's `instinct-inject.py` (a straight port of
`hooks/_lib/instinct_loader.py` + the resolver's role/confidence/dedup/sort
logic) runs BEFORE each `codex exec` call and concatenates the rendered
`## Learned Patterns` block into the assembled prompt — same position in the
prompt-assembly order as the Claude harness's Agent Spawn protocol (skill →
agent def → instincts → agent memory → session memory → scratchpad →
scratchpad-write-instruction).


#### Eval port


`internal-eval`'s baseline/suite/regression-diff machinery is scripts driving
an agent pipeline against fixed cases — swap the `codex exec` invocation in for
whatever ran the Claude-side pipeline per case, **keep the identical
`eval/baselines/{date}-{model}.md` file format**. This means a single
`eval/cases/` corpus can score BOTH harnesses and the reports are directly
diffable — a genuine bonus capability the origin harness doesn't have (no
cross-agent-vendor eval today).


#### Pipeline state


`pipeline-state/{task-id}/{phase}.md` kept byte-for-byte identical (YAML
frontmatter + Summary/Test Results/Key Findings/Next Phase Input sections). A
task started under the Claude harness can be resumed under codex-harness (or
vice versa) provided both point `HARNESS_DATA`/`$CODEX_HOME/harness-data` at
the same directory — genuinely portable state, no format translation needed.

**Summary of what actually strengthens vs weakens under Codex**: Law 4
(main-branch invariant) is the strongest native-hook parity point because
Codex's `PreToolUse` `command` hooks genuinely block, same as Claude's. Laws 1,
2, 5, 6, 7 downgrade to script-enforced-only because Codex has no pipeline-phase
or verdict-gate primitive at all — this is an intrinsic architecture gap, not
a hook-maturity gap, and will not close as Codex hooks mature further; it needs
the orchestration script to keep doing this work indefinitely. Law 3 downgrades
because Codex has no "orchestrator process" concept to gate — the invariant
becomes "the wrapper script's source is small and reviewed," a code-review-time
guarantee rather than a runtime one.

### Phase 7 — Contractor Handoff (strategy pivot, 2026-07-11)

The maintainer decided codex-harness will NOT be a full port of the
Claude harness's orchestration layer. Codex is a fallback **contractor**
used only when the Claude harness's 5-hour usage window runs out; Claude
remains primary and does the vast majority of pipeline work. The core
deliverable of this pivot is **shared runtime state**: both harnesses
point at ONE data root (`${HARNESS_DATA:-$HOME/.claude}`, the Claude
harness's live runtime dir — see AGENTS.md § Runtime Model) so
`pipeline-state/`, learning observations, and eval baselines are visible
to whichever side is on shift, with no sync step. A `HANDOFF.md` contract
plus an `ACTIVE_HARNESS` baton file (`pipeline-state/HANDOFF-CONTRACT.md`)
coordinate the shift change. The Claude side gains a matching `/handoff`
skill in a separate repo, added in parallel. Because Codex is now a
single-thread contractor rather than an independent orchestrator, the
full `scripts/codex-harness` dispatch layer (worktree-create →
parallel-`codex exec` → verdict-parse → phase-order state machine) is
no longer required to hit the goal — the Phase 2 rows that built that
layer (CX-20, CX-21, CX-24, CX-25, CX-26) are downgraded to
deferred/optional and superseded by this phase's thinner kit.

| ID | Description | Deliverable(s) | Acceptance Criteria | Deps | Size | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CX-70 | Shared `HARNESS_DATA` root | `AGENTS.md` § Runtime Model updated; `.codex/config.toml` memory-server comment updated | Default runtime-state root is `${HARNESS_DATA:-$HOME/.claude}`, matching the Claude harness's `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` default; seed-vs-runtime split language preserved; no remaining `$CODEX_HOME/harness-data` state-path reference in AGENTS.md | none | S | — |
| CX-71 | `HANDOFF.md` contract + `ACTIVE_HARNESS` baton | `pipeline-state/HANDOFF-CONTRACT.md` | Documents the full `HANDOFF.md` v1 frontmatter + section schema, the `ACTIVE_HARNESS` single-line baton format, and the reconcile-against-git rule; cross-references the Claude-side `/handoff` counterpart | CX-70 | S | — |
| CX-72 | `harness-resume-handoff` skill | `.agents/skills/harness-resume-handoff/SKILL.md` | Checks the baton before reading any `HANDOFF.md`; finds newest `baton: codex` handoff; reconciles against git/tests before trusting prose; continues `Next Actions` vertically (no subagent dispatch); wraps with a return `HANDOFF.md` (`baton: claude`) + baton flip; verdict block covers RESUMED/NO_BATON/NOTHING_TO_RESUME/STATE_DIVERGED | CX-71 | S | — |
| CX-73 | `source: codex` observation tagging | Documented in `pipeline-state/HANDOFF-CONTRACT.md` § Observation tagging; enforced by `harness-resume-handoff` Step 5 | Every observation the Codex side appends carries `"source": "codex"`; Claude-authored records may omit the field (defaults to `claude`) | CX-71, CX-72 | S | — |

## 6. Skill Port Catalog


Every directory under the source harness's `skills/` (77 entries, including
`README.md`, `_deferred`, `_template`). Decision legend: **PROMPT** = ports as
a Codex Skill (`.agents/skills/harness-<name>/SKILL.md`) largely unchanged;
**SCRIPT** = ports as a Python/bash script the orchestration layer calls
directly (not agent-invoked); **MERGED** = folded into another skill or into
`AGENTS.md`/`config.toml`/`hooks.json`; **DROPPED** = not ported.

## 7. Risks & Known Losses


- **No mid-session `PreToolUse` prompt-mutation interception.** Confirmed:
  Codex hooks parse but skip `prompt`/`agent` handler types. Any enforcement
  that depends on rewriting a tool call's *input* in place (not just
  allow/deny it) has no home on Codex today. The workaround (orchestration
  script pre-assembles the full prompt before the `codex exec` call ever
  happens) closes most of the gap for instinct/memory injection, but there is
  no way to intercept and modify a tool call the AGENT decides to make
  mid-turn (e.g., Claude's `cache-breakpoint-injector.sh` rewriting an Agent
  spawn's cache-control blocks after the orchestrator has already handed off).
- **Single-agent context contamination between phases.** The Claude harness's
  subagent-per-phase model keeps each phase's context clean by construction
  (a fresh subagent spawn per phase, no shared conversation history). Codex's
  `codex exec` model is closer to this than a long-lived session, so this risk
  is actually LOWER on Codex than initially assumed — flag as a positive
  finding, not a loss.
- **Cost profile differences.** Codex's model lineup (`gpt-5.6`,
  `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`) and reasoning-effort
  levels (`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`/`ultra`, model-dependent)
  do not map 1:1 onto the Claude harness's opus/sonnet/haiku tiering — the
  Agent Team table's per-role model defaults (§ CLAUDE.md source) need a fresh
  cost-quality calibration pass on Codex rather than a naive rename. Not
  attempted in this plan; flagged as a Phase 6+ follow-up.
- **Prompt-injection surface of `AGENTS.md`.** Same class of risk as Claude's
  `CLAUDE.md` — a nested `AGENTS.override.md` deeper in a checked-out repo can
  silently override the harness's own Iron Laws for that subtree. Codex's own
  docs acknowledge this precedence chain is intentional (nearer files win) —
  the harness AGENTS.md should say so explicitly and recommend reviewing any
  `AGENTS.override.md` encountered in an unfamiliar repo before trusting it,
  mirroring the general supply-chain caution the source harness already
  applies to `.codex/hooks/` trust review.
- **Hook-trust friction on every fresh clone.** Because Codex requires
  reviewing and trusting non-managed command hooks before they run
  (`/hooks` in the CLI), every fresh `codex-harness` checkout has a one-time
  manual trust step the Claude harness does not have (Claude's hooks are
  trusted by virtue of being inside `~/.claude/hooks/`, which the user already
  controls). This is a genuine UX regression versus Claude, not a bug in the
  port — document it prominently in the onboarding section of `AGENTS.md`.
- **Drift between harnesses.** Because both harnesses can share
  `pipeline-state/` and `learning/` (per §3's portability claims), a bug fixed
  in one harness's skill/hook logic but not the other's creates silent
  behavioral drift on shared state. Recommend a `scripts/lib/verify-parity.sh`
  smoke check (not scoped as a numbered task above — flag for a follow-up
  pipeline once both harnesses have run in production for a few weeks) that
  diffs the two `AGENTS.md`/`rules/core.md` Iron-Law transcriptions and fails
  CI on drift.
- **`.rules` is explicitly experimental.** OpenAI's own doc says "Rules are
  experimental and may change." Treat the Iron-Law-4-companion destructive-verb
  port (§4, CX-52) as defense-in-depth alongside the `main-branch-guard.sh`
  hook port, never as the sole enforcement layer.

## 8. Definition of Done (for the port itself)


The codex-harness port is DONE when ALL of the following hold:


- Phases 0-5 (CX-01 through CX-54) are complete with passing acceptance
  criteria as stated in §5.
- CX-60 (end-to-end T5-equivalent dry run) completes Plan → Build → Review →
  Ship on a trivial feature with no phase skipped, mirroring Iron Law 5's
  intent even though enforcement is script-level only (per §4).
- CX-61 (cross-harness eval comparison) produces a report showing the
  codex-harness case-pass-rate is within an agreed tolerance of the Claude
  harness's baseline on the SAME case set — not necessarily equal (different
  model families are expected to diverge somewhat), but not catastrophically
  worse.
- Every §2 table row has a fidelity rating and, for anything below FULL, an
  explicit substitution mechanism or DROPPED rationale — no silent gaps.
- Every §4 Iron Law has a stated Codex enforcement status — no law silently
  omitted from the transcription.
- `AGENTS.md` stands alone: a fresh Codex session reading only `AGENTS.md` (no
  chased file references) can state the phase order, the Iron Laws, the code
  shape rules, and the worktree/commit protocol without needing to open
  `PLAN.md` or any other file.
- CX-90 and CX-91 probes are run and their results (RED or GREEN) are recorded
  — even a RED result satisfies "not silently deferred," per the source
  harness's own Iron Law 6 spirit applied to this planning artifact.
- The Risks & Known Losses section (§7) is reviewed by a human before the
  first production pipeline run on codex-harness — this is a plan-review gate,
  not a mechanically-checkable one.
