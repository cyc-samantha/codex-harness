# PR Creation Workflow

## Current Context
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Changed files: !`git diff main...HEAD --name-only 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A'`
- Diff stats: !`git diff main...HEAD --stat 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A'`

## What This Skill Does

Automated pull request creation with validation:
1. Run pre-push validation (linting, tests, security)
2. Ensure on feature branch
3. Commit all changes with descriptive message
4. Push to remote
5. Create GitHub PR with proper formatting
6. Return PR URL

## Known Misfire Mode (Claude-side history, kept for the description-shape lesson)

On the Claude harness, this skill's model-invocation routing once misfired
when the `description` field lacked an action cue (`"Use when user
wants to ..."`) — the skill body loaded as reference documentation
instead of an executable procedure. This repo's frontmatter (description
+ `argument-hint` + `## Process`-shaped body) already follows the fixed
convention. If a Codex session ever "stands by" instead of executing
Steps 0-5 below, that same description-shape issue is the first thing to
check; there is no orchestrator-side workaround on Codex (no
`fix-engineer` role to hand this to) — re-invoke the skill directly, or
work the steps below manually if invocation keeps failing.

## Prerequisites

- Feature branch created (`feature/description`)
- All changes ready to commit
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated

## Step 0 — Approval Token Gate (HARD GATE)

Before any branch operations, verify an approval token authorizes this
PR. On the Claude side, a `product-acceptance` phase writes this token;
this repo does not carry that skill (it is Plan/Accept-phase machinery,
out of scope for the contractor kit), so treat a missing token the same
as the "No active pipeline" case below rather than trying to author one
yourself:

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}}/hooks/_lib/approval-token.sh"
bash "$(dirname "$0")/lib/check-approval-token.sh"
GATE_EXIT=$?
if [ "$GATE_EXIT" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "PR_BLOCKED — see output above for remediation."
  exit 2
fi
```

Or invoke via the skill wrapper directly:
```bash
bash "$WORKTREE/skills/pr-creation/lib/check-approval-token.sh"
```

- **APPROVED** or **APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS**: proceed to Step 1.
- **Missing token** or **REJECTED**: exits with `PR_BLOCKED` message including remediation hint.
- **No active pipeline** (no `$state_dir/{task-id}/pipeline.md` and no legacy `$state_dir/{task-id}-pipeline.md`): manual PR path — gate skips, proceed.

Cross-references: `hooks/auto-pr.sh` performs an advisory read of the same token and suppresses its PR suggestion when the gate is closed.

## Verification Freshness Dependency

`hooks/quality-gate.sh` runs on `gh pr create` and includes the new `_qg_check_freshness` check (extension landed in this slice). The check reads `$state_dir/{task-id}/verification-evidence.json` written by `/harness:verify` Step 6 and FAILs (rc=1 → quality-gate exit 2) when the recorded `git_head` does not match the current worktree HEAD, the file is missing, or the verdict is not `VERIFIED` / `VERIFIED_WITH_SKIP`. Operators must re-run `/harness:verify` before re-attempting `gh pr create` in that case.

## Worktree Precondition (HARD GATE)

This skill mutates HEAD-bearing state (creates branches, runs `gh pr create` which pushes the current branch). It MUST run inside a worktree, never against REPO_ROOT directly. Resolve the worktree path at skill entry:

```bash
WORKTREE="$(cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && pwd -P)"
COMMON_DIR_ABS="$(cd "$WORKTREE" && cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" && pwd -P)"
GIT_DIR_ABS="$(cd "$WORKTREE" && cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" && pwd -P)"
if [[ "$COMMON_DIR_ABS" == "$GIT_DIR_ABS" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: pr-creation must run from a worktree; cwd resolves to REPO_ROOT" >&2
  exit 2
fi
```

All subsequent commands in this skill use `git -C "$WORKTREE" ...` or `(cd "$WORKTREE" && ...)`. Bare `git checkout|switch|merge|...` and bare `gh pr create` are blocked by `hooks/main-branch-guard.sh` regardless of cwd. See `protocols/agent-protocol.md > ## Main-Branch Invariant`.

## Context

Gather state before starting:

```bash
# Current branch and changes
git -C "$WORKTREE" status
git -C "$WORKTREE" log --oneline -5
git -C "$WORKTREE" diff --stat
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Complete PR workflow (must run from a worktree — see Worktree Precondition)
(cd "$WORKTREE" && git push -u origin feature/my-feature && \
 gh pr create --title "..." --body "...")
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Verify Feature Branch

```bash
# Check current branch
git -C "$WORKTREE" status

# Branch creation uses worktree add — the only sanctioned form
git -C "$REPO_ROOT" worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b feature/add-notification-system
# The orchestrator handles this via hooks/worktree-create.sh; agents reference $WORKTREE_PATH
```

### 2. Run Pre-Push Validation

#### Hook-Change Pytest Gate (HARD GATE)

Run the gate BEFORE calling any PR-creation command (step 5 below):

```bash
# $WORKTREE is already resolved and validated by the Worktree Precondition above.
bash "$WORKTREE/skills/pr-creation/lib/check-hook-pytest-gate.sh"
GATE_EXIT=$?
if [ "$GATE_EXIT" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "PR_BLOCKED — hook-change pytest gate failed. See output above."
  exit 2
fi
```

This gate fires when `main...HEAD` touches a `hooks/*.sh` or `hooks/_lib/*.sh` body
line, and runs the targeted pytest subset from the worktree. Any red blocks the PR
(exit 2). It is bypass-proof vs `gh api` because it is a SKILL STEP — see GP-19.

- **No hook body change**: gate no-ops, exits 0, no pytest invoked.
- **Hook body changed + subset green**: exits 0, proceed.
- **Hook body changed + subset red**: exits 2 (`PR_BLOCKED`). Fix the failing tests, then retry Ship.
- **Bypass** (pre-existing, unrelated failures confirmed): `CLAUDE_DISABLE_HOOK_PYTEST_GATE=1` then re-run Ship.

#### Quality Gate (HARD GATE — path-independent)

Run AFTER the hook-pytest gate and BEFORE any PR-creation command (step 5 below).
This gate runs `_qg_check_tests|lint|audit|shape|contract|freshness` regardless of
which tool creates the PR (`gh pr create`, `gh api`, or MCP `create_pull_request`).
A Bash hook matcher fires only for `gh pr create` — this skill step is bypass-proof.

WHY: `hooks/quality-gate.sh:23` exits 0 for any non-`gh pr create` tool, so MCP and
`gh api` skip the hook entirely. This step closes that gap. GP-C1, issue #33106
(`permissionDecision:deny` is not enforced for MCP tools).

Cross-references: §Verification Freshness Dependency (evidence must be fresh before
this gate can pass).

```bash
# $WORKTREE is already resolved and validated by the Worktree Precondition above.
bash "$WORKTREE/skills/pr-creation/lib/check-quality-gate.sh"
GATE_EXIT=$?
if [ "$GATE_EXIT" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "PR_BLOCKED — quality gate failed. See output above."
  exit 2
fi
```

- **All checks pass**: exits 0, proceed to commit + push + PR creation.
- **Any check fails**: exits 2 (`PR_BLOCKED`). Fix the failing check, then retry Ship.
- **Bypass** (pre-existing, unrelated failures confirmed): `CLAUDE_DISABLE_QUALITY_GATE=1` then re-run Ship.
- **Skip heavy checks only** (test-suite isolation): `CLAUDE_QG_SKIP_CHECKS=1` — freshness still evaluated.

Run all quality checks before pushing:
- Linting (language-appropriate linter)
- Security scanning
- Test suite with coverage
- Database consistency checks (if applicable)

Only proceed when all checks pass.

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add [specific files by name — never use 'git add .' or 'git add -A']
# Review staged files before committing: git diff --cached --name-only
# Verify no .env, credentials, or binary artifacts are included

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
- Detail 3

Closes TICKET-123

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### 4. Push to Remote

```bash
# Push feature branch (first time)
git push -u origin feature/add-notification-system

# Or subsequent pushes
git push
```

### 5. Create Pull Request

Before calling `gh pr create` (or `gh api .../pulls`, or MCP `create_pull_request`),
run `check-quality-gate.sh` to gate ALL PR creation paths (see §Step 2 Quality Gate
above). `gh api .../pulls` bypasses the Bash hook — this step is the path-independent
gate. GP-C1, issue #33106.

```bash
bash "$WORKTREE/skills/pr-creation/lib/check-quality-gate.sh"
GATE_EXIT=$?
[ "$GATE_EXIT" -ne 0 ] && { echo "PR_BLOCKED — quality gate failed."; exit 2; }
```

Then append the eval-baseline stamp to the body:

```bash
# Capture the stamp (harness repo only; no-op in other projects)
STAMP=""
if [ -x "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}}/skills/internal-eval/score/stamp-pr-body.sh" ]; then
  STAMP="$(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}}/skills/internal-eval/score/stamp-pr-body.sh" 2>/dev/null || true)"
fi

# Create PR with detailed description + eval baseline stamp.
# The (cd "$WORKTREE" && ...) wrapper is required by the main-branch invariant
# guard — bare `gh pr create` is blocked by hooks/main-branch-guard.sh.
(cd "$WORKTREE" && gh pr create \
  --title "type(scope): description (TICKET-123)" \
  --body "$(cat <<EOF

```

The eval-baseline stamp is appended to every PR body so reviewers see the latest suite pass rate + `harness_ref` SHA without per-PR reruns. See `~/.claude/skills/internal-eval/score/stamp-pr-body.sh`.

### 5b. Watch remote CI (Monitor event-stream — this skill's own CI-green gate)

After `PR_CREATED`, run an advisory CI-watch yourself before proceeding to
the cost annotator. This sub-phase drives the in-cycle fix loop on RED and emits
`watch-skipped:operator-cancel` on operator interruption. It subscribes to a Monitor
event-stream for results — the subscription itself is advisory (not a blocking gate).
The enforcing CI-green gate is `ci_status_decision(PR)`, defined inline below (this
§ 5b's own GREEN/RED/PENDING decision procedure) — it blocks `Ship→Deploy` on any
non-conclusively-green status. There is no separate pipeline-phase gate on the
Codex side and no external helper script; this skill carries its own enforcement
end to end.

**`ci_status_decision(PR)` decision procedure** (the authoritative live re-check,
distinct from the advisory event-stream subscription above):
- **GREEN**: every check-run matched to the captured `headRefOid` has concluded
  `success` or `skipped`, AND at least one matched run exists.
- **RED**: any matched run concluded `failure`, `cancelled`, or `timed_out`.
- **PENDING**: any matched run is still `in_progress` or `queued` — wait, do not
  decide yet.
- **Unevaluable** (no matched runs, `gh pr checks` errors, or a state that fits
  none of the above): fail closed — never emit `CI_GREEN`. Route to
  `watch-skipped:<reason>` per the unreadable/no-runs path below.

**Arm the event-stream subscription:**

```bash
# Capture headRefOid at arm time — this is the pushed commit SHA.
# A force-push between arm and conclusion cannot produce a false-green
# against a commit whose CI was never evaluated.
HEAD_OID=$(gh pr view <pr-number> --json headRefOid -q '.headRefOid')
# SAFETY: Validate <pr-number> matches ^[0-9]+$ before interpolating; double-quote
# all interpolated placeholders in gh/git commands (e.g. `gh pr checks "$PR"`,
# `git ls-remote "$remote" "$branch"`) to prevent word-splitting and injection.
```

Subscribe to the Monitor event-stream for `<pr>`. The Monitor emits one structured line per concluded run (`conclusion` + `sha` + PR). The orchestrator blocks on the
next event rather than spinning — this is an event-stream subscription, not a
busy-wait loop. Each event line is parsed by `skills/pr-creation/lib/ci-event-decode.sh`,
which classifies the line as `RED-hint`, `candidate-green`, or exits 2 for any
unevaluable input (Iron Law 8). Compare the event SHA against the captured `headRefOid`
— if the SHA does not match, skip it (stale run from a previous push).

**Note: silence is not success.** The orchestrator wraps the Monitor subscription with a
bounded deadline (Monitor `timeout_ms` / orchestrator-wrapped bounded deadline;
default floor: 30 minutes). Silence past the budget routes to
`CI status: watch-skipped:<reason>` — the watch is bounded by the silence deadline, never hanging.
While the subscription is active, the operator sees:
"CI-watch armed (event-stream) — awaiting first CI event."

**GREEN path — emit `CI_GREEN`:**

When ≥1 check-run matches the captured `headRefOid` AND the decoder classifies all
matched events as `candidate-green`:
- The GREEN decision is NOT made on the event alone. The candidate-green event triggers
  an authoritative `ci_status_decision(PR)` live re-check (the decision procedure
  defined in § 5b above). Only a GREEN result from that procedure emits `CI_GREEN`.
  A forged or stale event can never produce a false green.
- Proceed to Step 6 (cost annotator).

If the matched-run set is empty (zero check-runs match the captured `headRefOid` —
e.g. a force-push made every visible run stale), this is NOT a GREEN signal.
Route to `CI status: watch-skipped:no-matching-runs` and proceed (same as the
unreadable / no-runs path). CI_GREEN requires ≥1 matched run.

**RED-hint path — emit `CI_RED`, re-enter fix loop:**

When the decoder returns `RED-hint` (≥1 event against `headRefOid` with a FAILURE
conclusion):
1. Emit a PushNotification: "CI red on #<pr> — re-entering fix loop in <window>s
   unless you cancel." The operator has a notify + cancel window to intervene before
   the fix loop starts. If the operator cancels within the window, emit
   `watch-skipped:operator-cancel` (see Operator cancel escape hatch below).
2. Pull the failing logs: `gh pr checks "$PR" --log-failed`
   # SAFETY: Do NOT persist --log-failed output into the PR body, a PR comment,
   # the scratchpad, or an observation — CI failure logs commonly contain secrets
   # in stack traces. The logs feed the in-cycle fix loop only.
3. Emit `CI_RED`.
4. Re-enter the in-cycle fix loop: spawn fix-engineer on the **SAME build worktree**
   (not a fresh one — the build worktree retains the full branch history).
5. After fix-engineer reports a fix committed and pushed, verify the fix-engineer's
   claimed/expected SHA actually reached the remote **before re-arming**.
   The orchestrator holds the expected SHA from the fix-engineer's report; confirm
   the remote branch head **equals** that expected SHA:
   ```bash
   git ls-remote "$remote" "$branch"
   ```
   If `git ls-remote` shows the branch head does NOT equal the fix-engineer's
   claimed SHA, the fix-engineer stalled at push. Surface "fix not on remote —
   fix-engineer stalled, manual recovery needed" and halt re-arming. (See memory:
   `ship-must-watch-remote-ci`, `fix-engineer-nested-worktree-side-branch` —
   fix-engineer subagents stall silently at commit/push; never trust self-report.)
6. Use the `git ls-remote`-confirmed SHA as the new HEAD_OID and re-arm the
   event-stream subscription. This threads the single ls-remote-confirmed value
   through both step-5 verification and step-6 re-arm — there is no second source
   for the new HEAD_OID.

**Re-entry latency:** The time-of-failure-event triggers fix-loop re-entry, not the
next poll-interval tick. Re-entry latency drops from poll-interval to time-of-failure-event.

**Operator cancel escape hatch:**

If the operator cancels within the notify window or interrupts the subscription
mid-flight (e.g. known CI flake, a stalled fix loop), emit:

```
CI status: watch-skipped:operator-cancel
```

with an explicit note: "CI status unverified — the advisory watch did not confirm
a CI conclusion. NOTE: the enforcing CI-green gate (`ci_status_decision(PR)`, this
skill's own § 5b GREEN/RED path logic) runs next and will BLOCK Ship→Deploy unless
CI is conclusively green (or the operator sets `CLAUDE_CI_GREEN_GATE=off`).
Cancelling the watch does not bypass the gate."

**Unreadable / no-runs path:**

If `gh pr checks` returns no runs or errors, or the decoder exits 2 for every event
line, emit `CI status: watch-skipped:<reason>` and proceed. `watch-skipped` leaves
CI status unverified for the advisory watch; the enforcing CI-green gate
(`ci_status_decision(PR)`, this skill's own § 5b GREEN/RED path logic) then BLOCKs
Ship→Deploy on unreadable/non-green status.

### 6. Annotate PR cost on CI-green

After the CI-watch (Step 5b) confirms all checks pass against the pushed headRefOid,
invoke the cost annotator:

```bash
python3 "${HARNESS_ROOT}/hooks/_lib/pr_cost_annotate.py" <pr-number>
```

The annotator resolves the live session transcript (newest `*.jsonl` under
`~/.claude/projects/{cwd-slug}/`, excluding `subagents/` subdirs), sums
token usage by model via `transcript_usage.sum_usage_by_model`, prices it
via `cost_estimator.estimate_cost_usd`, then PATCHes the PR body — replacing
the `**Pipeline cost:** _pending CI_` sentinel line with the real figure.

- **Fail-open**: any error (no transcript, gh failure, compute error) is
  caught, printed to stderr, and the script exits 0. The sentinel is left
  intact. The PR is never blocked.
- **Idempotent**: safe to run more than once — exactly one cost line results.
- **On by default**: no env flag required.

## Branch Naming Conventions

**Pattern**: `{type}/{description}`

Types:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `test/` - Test improvements

## Autonomous PR Creation

When user says "create PR", execute autonomously:

1. Run validation checks (MUST pass)
2. Verify feature branch or create
3. Stage and commit all changes
4. **Run `check-quality-gate.sh` BEFORE creating the PR** (HARD GATE — path-independent):
   ```bash
   bash "$WORKTREE/skills/pr-creation/lib/check-quality-gate.sh"
   GATE_EXIT=$?
   [ "$GATE_EXIT" -ne 0 ] && { echo "PR_BLOCKED — quality gate failed."; exit 2; }
   ```
   WHY: `gh api .../pulls` bypasses the Bash hook at `hooks/quality-gate.sh:23`; this
   step gates ALL PR paths (gh pr create, gh api, MCP). GP-C1, issue #33106.
5. Push to remote with `-u` flag
6. Create GitHub PR via `(cd "$WORKTREE" && gh pr create ...)` — the `cd "$WORKTREE"` prefix is required by the main-branch invariant guard
7. Return PR URL to user

**Don't ask** -- just do it with reasonable defaults based on commit messages, files changed, and tests added.

## Error Handling

### Validation fails
Review output, fix failures, re-run until passing.

### Already on main branch
Create feature branch, move changes to it.

### PR creation fails (gh CLI)
Verify `gh auth status`, re-authenticate if needed, retry.

### Remote branch conflicts
Pull latest main, rebase feature branch, resolve conflicts, push with `--force-with-lease`.

## Decision Narrative

Every PR includes a non-technical decision narrative section:

1. **Write a summary of your own work**: before finishing, write 2-3 sentences on what you did, decisions made, and trade-offs — there is no separate agent output to collect this from.
2. **Assemble into PR body** under a "## Decision Log" section:
   - **What**: What was built and why (business context)
   - **Why**: Key decisions and trade-offs (what was considered and rejected)
   - **How**: Design rationale, review findings from your own `$harness-code-review`/`$harness-security-review` pass
   - **Verified**: Verification report summary in plain language
3. Must be readable by non-technical stakeholders (product owners, designers)

## Changelog & PR Narrative

Before assembling the PR body (Step 5), invoke `/harness:changelog` to derive the
`## Summary` narrative and append a Keep-a-Changelog entry under `Unreleased`:

1. Run `/harness:changelog` against `main...HEAD` + the task ACs.
2. Use its returned PR narrative as the `## Summary` block of the PR body.
3. The skill stages the project `CHANGELOG.md` edit; commit it with the change so
   every merged PR carries a human-readable changelog line.
4. **CHANGELOG_SKIPPED** (docs/test-only diff) is non-blocking — use the returned
   narrative for the body and proceed without a changelog edit.

This closes the technical-writing gap: a production-grade PR ships a record a
non-author can read, not just a green diff. See `.agents/skills/harness-changelog/SKILL.md`.

## Multi-Repo PRs (When Manifest Exists)

When the pipeline provides a manifest path, this skill creates linked PRs:

### Procedure
1. **Read manifest**: Get repo list, dependency graph, GitHub config
2. **Create PRs in dependency order**: Providers first, consumers after
3. **Cross-reference**: Each PR body includes:
   ```markdown
   ## Related PRs
   - Depends on: {org}/{provider-repo}#{N} (must merge first)
   - Depended on by: {org}/{consumer-repo}#{N}
   ```
4. **Apply labels**: From manifest `## Services > GitHub > labels` if configured
5. **Return all PR URLs**: Record them yourself in the pipeline state PR Manifest — there is no orchestrator tracking this on your behalf.

### Merge Order
This skill only creates PRs; it does not merge them. It adds a `## Merge Order` note to each PR body so human reviewers (or whichever harness picks up the merge step) understand the dependency.

## Best Practices

- Always run validation before pushing
- Use descriptive feature branch names
- Write comprehensive PR descriptions
- Include test results and coverage
- Include decision narrative from participating agents
- Reference tickets
- Add co-authoring attribution
- Never push to main/master

## Prerequisite

- Build/fix work complete: BUILD_COMPLETE, APPROVE (both `$harness-code-review` and `$harness-security-review`)
- If this PR is part of a full Claude-orchestrated pipeline, its Accept-phase approval token exists (Step 0 above handles the "no active pipeline" case when it doesn't)

## Verdict

- **PR_CREATED**: PR URL returned, quality gate hook passed. Advisory CI-watch (Step 5b) follows.
- **PR_BLOCKED**: Quality gate failed. Fix issues and retry.
- **CI_GREEN**: All `gh pr checks` runs concluded SUCCESS against the pushed headRefOid; CI-green gate passed — proceed to cost annotator (Step 6) then Deploy.
- **CI_RED**: ≥1 `gh pr checks` run concluded FAILURE (or CI status unreadable); pull `--log-failed`, re-enter in-cycle fix loop, verify `git ls-remote` == claimed SHA, re-arm watch. The enforcing CI-green gate (`ci_status_decision(PR)`, this skill's own § 5b GREEN/RED path logic) HALTS Ship→Deploy until CI is conclusively green.

## Phase Output

```
Verdict: PR_CREATED / PR_BLOCKED / CI_GREEN / CI_RED
Next: After PR_CREATED, run the advisory CI-watch sub-phase (Step 5b). On CI_GREEN, annotate cost (Step 6) then pipeline complete / Deploy entry. On CI_RED, re-enter in-cycle fix loop and re-arm.
