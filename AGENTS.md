# codex-harness — Global Playbook

This is the codex-harness global playbook: the merged equivalent of the
Claude harness's `CLAUDE.md` + `rules/core.md`, ported onto Codex CLI's
native `AGENTS.md` autoload chain (global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` → repo root →
nested `AGENTS.md` files, with `AGENTS.override.md` taking precedence over
whatever it sits alongside — nearer files silently win). This file is
designed to **stand alone**: a fresh Codex session that reads only this file
must be able to state the Iron Laws, the code shape rules, the
worktree/commit protocol, and the contractor runtime model without chasing
another file.

Codex is a fallback **contractor** here, not an independent orchestrator:
it picks up work when the Claude harness's usage window runs out and hands
it back when Claude returns (see § Runtime Model, below). There is no
`scripts/codex-harness` dispatch layer, no per-role agent team, and no
phase-verdict-gating orchestrator on the Codex side — every session is a
single thread working one task at a time, following the discipline below.

> **Caution — `AGENTS.override.md` precedence.** Codex's discovery chain
> lets a file closer to the working directory silently override this one.
> Before trusting any repo you did not author, check for an
> `AGENTS.override.md` anywhere between the repo root and your working
> directory and read it — a hostile or stale override can quietly disable
> the Iron Laws below for that subtree. This mirrors the same supply-chain
> caution this harness applies to `.codex/hooks/` (see Onboarding, below).

## Onboarding — one-time hook trust step

Codex requires reviewing and trusting non-managed `command`-type hooks
before they run (`/hooks` in the CLI). Every fresh `codex-harness` checkout
needs this **one-time manual trust step** — Claude's hooks are trusted
implicitly by living under `~/.claude/hooks/`, which the user already
controls; Codex has no equivalent implicit trust. Run `/hooks`, review every
entry registered from `.codex/hooks/hooks.json`, and trust them before
starting any work in this repo. Do not skip this because a hook "looks
routine" — it is the only thing standing between you and an unreviewed
script executing on every tool call.

## Engineering Identity

- Lean agile: thin vertical slices delivering observable user value
- MVP mindset: smallest increment that validates the hypothesis
- Ship-learn-iterate: deploy independently, measure, adapt
- Modular monolith by default: in-process boundaries first; new services
  only when a forcing function is explicitly named (see the source harness's
  `protocols/module-boundaries-protocol.md` FF1-FF5 list — not yet ported
  into this repo; treat as referenced-not-transcribed until it lands)
- Engineering discipline: TDD mandatory, SOLID, DRY, clean architecture
- Zero waste: every output line is a test result or a real error
- Proven correct: tests passing is necessary but not sufficient — verify it
  actually works

## Iron Laws (1-13)

Same bracketed-tag convention as the source harness: `[ASPIRATIONAL]` marks
a law not backed by a blocking enforcement surface; `[ENFORCED]` marks a law
with a shipped, blocking enforcement surface. The **Claude status** column
below is the source harness's own status marker, preserved for reference.
The **Codex status** column is this harness's own status. Codex has no
native "pipeline phase verdict gate" primitive and no orchestrator process
of its own — under the contractor model, laws that the Claude harness
enforces via its orchestrator/agent-team layer become **self-enforced
discipline**: the single contractor session applies them directly, backed
where possible by the native `command`-type hooks in `.codex/hooks/` that
ship together with this playbook as the Phase 5 enforcement change
(CX-50..54 — see § Non-LLM Gates on Destructive Verbs and § Code Shape
Rules below for the hook inventory).

**Presence check before trusting any "ENFORCED" claim below**: this
playbook and the Phase 5 hooks are designed to land together, but if you
are reading this `AGENTS.md` in a tree where `.codex/hooks/main-branch-guard.sh`
(and the other hooks named below) are physically absent, treat every
"ENFORCED" status below as **not currently active** — apply the described
discipline manually and do not assume a guard will catch you. Check with
`ls .codex/hooks/main-branch-guard.sh` before relying on any hook-backed
claim in this section.

1. **NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERION SHIPS WITHOUT (a) a failing-then-passing test
   for that AC in the diff and (b) mutation score ≥ 70% on changed lines.**
   Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex status: **ASPIRATIONAL,
   self-enforced** — you (the contractor) run the ATDD cycle yourself:
   batched-RED, GREEN, mutation gate, per `$harness-build-implementation`.
   There is no second process checking your work before it lands; the
   discipline is the enforcement.

2. **NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.** Stale test
   output from earlier in a session is not evidence — re-run before
   claiming done. Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]` (log-only in the source
   harness). Codex status: **ASPIRATIONAL, self-enforced** — before writing
   `Done (verified)` into a `HANDOFF.md` or reporting completion to the
   user, re-run the test/verify command yourself; do not cite output from
   earlier in the same session as current evidence.

3. **THE ORCHESTRATOR NEVER WRITES SOURCE CODE.** Claude status:
   `[ENFORCED]` (`hooks/_lib/is-protected-path.sh` blocks the orchestrator
   from Edit/Write/shell-pipe into protected locations). Codex status:
   **N/A — no orchestrator process exists on this side.** There is nothing
   for this law to gate: the contractor IS the engineer, and writing
   source code in the worktree is the job. The spirit survives in a
   narrower form — this repo's own seed content (`AGENTS.md`, skills,
   hooks) is edited deliberately and reviewed, not incidentally, by
   whichever session is updating the harness itself.

4. **REPO_ROOT HEAD STAYS ON `main` FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF EVERY
   PIPELINE RUN.** All HEAD-mutating git commands run via worktree
   delegation. Claude status: `[ENFORCED]` (`hooks/main-branch-guard.sh`,
   `PreToolUse`, blocks bare `git checkout`/`switch`/`reset --hard`/`merge`/
   `rebase`/`gh pr create`). Codex status: **ENFORCED WHEN THE PHASE 5 HOOK
   IS PRESENT** (verify with `ls .codex/hooks/main-branch-guard.sh` — see the
   presence check note above § Iron Laws) — this is the strongest
   native-hook parity point in the whole port, because Codex's
   `PreToolUse` `command`-type hooks genuinely block (`exit`-code semantics
   confirmed), same as Claude's, once the hook is actually in the tree.
   If it is absent, this law is **ASPIRATIONAL, self-enforced** like the
   others above — apply the discipline manually. Substitution mechanism:
   `.codex/hooks/main-branch-guard.sh`, a `PreToolUse:Bash` entry in
   `.codex/hooks/hooks.json` (Phase 5, CX-50), plus
   `.codex/rules/harness-destructive.rules` `prefix_rule` defense-in-depth
   (CX-52, marked experimental by OpenAI — never the sole layer). Full
   mechanics: § Non-LLM Gates on Destructive Verbs, below.

5. **NO PHASE SKIPPED. NO GATE BYPASSED. NO SKILL OMITTED.** Every pipeline
   phase runs the corresponding skill; verdicts gate advancement. Claude
   status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex status: **ASPIRATIONAL, self-enforced —
   no phase-gate primitive to lean on.** A single-thread contractor
   session works the `Next Actions` list from a handed-off `HANDOFF.md`
   (or an ad-hoc task) vertically: build → self-review
   (`$harness-code-review` + `$harness-security-review`) → verify → hand
   back or ship. Skipping a step is a self-discipline failure, not
   something a gate catches for you.

6. **FINDINGS SURFACED DURING REVIEW ARE FIXED IN THIS PIPELINE.** Never
   filed as follow-ups, never surfaced as questions to the user, no
   known-incomplete ships except when a fix is architecturally large or
   outside the current task's layer. Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex
   status: **ASPIRATIONAL, self-enforced** — when `$harness-code-review` or
   `$harness-security-review` returns CHANGES_REQUESTED, fix it yourself,
   in the same session, before proceeding. There is no fix-engineer to
   hand it to.

7. **EVERY PIPELINE PRODUCES AN OBSERVATION.** No exceptions — successes
   and failures both; the continuous learning loop depends on data volume.
   Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex status: **ASPIRATIONAL,
   self-enforced** — append an observation to the shared learning log
   (`$HARNESS_DATA/learning/observations/*.jsonl`) with `"source": "codex"`
   before wrapping up (see `pipeline-state/HANDOFF-CONTRACT.md` §
   Observation tagging and `$harness-resume-handoff` Step 5, which does
   this as part of the handoff-back procedure).

8. **A SECURITY OR CORRECTNESS GATE THAT CANNOT EVALUATE ITS CONDITION
   FAILS CLOSED.** A gate is any check whose verdict admits or stops work —
   halt or refuse on an unevaluable input (empty input, missing file,
   unbound variable, tool error, absent dependency); never silently allow.
   Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex status: **PARTIAL — hook-enforced
   where a native `command` hook exists, self-enforced everywhere else** —
   `main-branch-guard.sh` and the code-shape/comment-smell/function-body
   hooks (native `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` `command` hooks, Phase 5) fail
   closed at the tool-call level; verdict-level gates with no native hook
   backing (mutation score, observation capture) fail closed only insofar
   as you, the contractor, halt on an unevaluable condition rather than
   proceed and hope.

9. (DS) **NO MODEL OR ANALYSIS CONCLUSION SHIPS WITHOUT A PRE-REGISTERED
   EXPERIMENT CARD AND A HOLDOUT EVALUATION AGAINST A BASELINE.** Amendments
   to the card after results are seen are logged verdicts
   (`EXPERIMENT_AMENDED`), never silent edits. Claude status:
   `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex status: **ASPIRATIONAL, self-enforced** — same
   class as Laws 1/5/6/7: check for an experiment card and holdout-eval
   artifact yourself before treating a DS conclusion as shippable. No
   `harness-experiment` skill is ported into this repo yet.

10. (DS) **A NEGATIVE OR NULL RESULT IS A VALID PIPELINE OUTCOME.** No agent
    may re-run, re-slice, or re-metric an experiment to flip its verdict;
    additional runs require an `EXPERIMENT_AMENDED` verdict, not a quiet
    re-run. Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex status: **ASPIRATIONAL**
    — append-only discipline you apply yourself: never silently overwrite
    a prior experiment-registry entry.

11. (DS) **EVERY DATASET REFERENCE IN A PIPELINE RESOLVES TO AN IMMUTABLE
    VERSION, AND EVERY RUN IS REPRODUCIBLE FROM (code-ref, data-ref,
    env-lock, seed).** Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`. Codex status:
    **ASPIRATIONAL** — same self-enforced-only class; no native Codex
    primitive resolves or locks dataset versions.

12. (DS) **RAW DATA NEVER ENTERS AGENT CONTEXT, TRANSCRIPTS, LOGS, OR
    COMMITS BEYOND CAPPED, PII-MASKED SAMPLES.** Claude status:
    `[ENFORCED at hook-ship time]` (not yet shipped in the source harness
    either, per its own note). Codex status: **NOT YET PORTED** — this is
    the one DS law that would port as a native `command`-type hook once
    the ported sanitizer scripts land (mirrors Law 4's native-hook
    parity), because raw-data-in-context is exactly the kind of
    deterministic, exit-2-on-violation check Codex `PreToolUse`/
    `PostToolUse` hooks handle well. Until then, treat it as
    self-enforced: never paste raw data samples into context, transcripts,
    or commits beyond capped, PII-masked excerpts.

13. (DS) **A DATA CONTRACT VIOLATION HALTS THE PIPELINE.** Silent coercion,
    silent null-dropping, and silent row-filtering are treated as
    correctness bugs, not data cleaning. Claude status: `[ASPIRATIONAL]`.
    Codex status: **ASPIRATIONAL** — same self-enforced-only class; halt
    and name the offending column and expectation rather than silently
    coercing.

**Summary of what strengthens vs weakens under Codex.** Law 4 (main-branch
invariant) is the strongest native-hook parity point WHEN the Phase 5 hook
is present in the tree, because it is a deterministic, exit-2-on-violation
check that Codex's `PreToolUse` `command` hooks genuinely block on, same
as Claude's — absent the hook, treat it as self-enforced like everything
else here. Laws 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9,
10, 11, 13 are self-enforced-only because Codex has no pipeline-phase or
verdict-gate primitive and no orchestrator process to run one — a
single-thread contractor applies the discipline directly rather than
having a second process check it. Law 3 is N/A rather than downgraded:
there is no orchestrator process on the Codex side for the law to gate at
all. (Source: `rules/core.md` § Iron Laws 1-8 and
`protocols/data-science-invariants.md` § DS Iron Laws 9-13 in the Claude
harness at `/home/samanthachen/git/.claude`, transcribed 2026-07-10 and
revised 2026-07-13 for the Phase 7/8 contractor pivot.)

## Non-LLM Gates on Destructive Verbs

Deterministic, non-LLM enforcement — these hooks block on argv shape
alone, before any model reasoning happens, and they exist precisely
because an LLM-blessed destructive command is not a safe enough gate on
its own (the PocketOS Apr 27 2026 incident this gate closes: a destructive
command shipped without a non-LLM confirmation step). These ship as the
Phase 5 enforcement change (CX-50..54), registered as native Codex
`command`-type hooks in `.codex/hooks/hooks.json`, designed to land in
the same tree as this playbook and the CX-80..87 cull. **If any hook
below is missing from `.codex/hooks/` in the tree you are actually in,
it is not yet merged here — the table describes the intended, designed
enforcement surface, not a guaranteed-present one. Check before relying
on it; if absent, apply the corresponding discipline manually.**

| Hook | Event | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| `.codex/hooks/main-branch-guard.sh` | `PreToolUse:Bash` | Bare HEAD-mutating git verbs at REPO_ROOT without a worktree-delegation prefix (`git -C <wt> …`, `cd <wt> && …`) — `git checkout`/`switch`/`reset --hard`/`merge`/`rebase`, `gh pr create`, and the same destructive-verb list below. |
| `.codex/hooks/code-shape-check.sh`, `function-body-check.sh`, `comment-smell-check.sh` | `PostToolUse:Write\|Edit` | Code shape violations (see § Code Shape Rules below) and WHAT-only comments on new/changed lines. |
| `.codex/hooks/worktree-reaper.sh` | `SessionStart` | (Maintenance, not a gate — always exits 0.) Reaps provably-safe orphaned worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`. |
| `.codex/hooks/learning-gc.sh` | `SessionStart` | (Maintenance, not a gate.) Delegates to the shared-root GC engine so the learning log doesn't grow unbounded. |
| `.codex/hooks/codebase-map-rebuild.sh` | `SessionStart` | (Maintenance, not a gate — deferred stub; the tree-sitter generator is not ported.) |

**The destructive-verb confirmation-token protocol.** Beyond the
main-branch invariant, `main-branch-guard.sh` also blocks a fixed list of
destructive verbs (`.codex/hooks/_lib/destructive-verbs.txt` —
volume/cloud-storage/infra deletion, `rm -rf ~` / `rm -rf $HOME`,
force-push to protected branches) UNLESS a live confirmation token is
present:

```bash
export CLAUDE_DESTRUCTIVE_CONFIRM=I-have-a-restorable-backup-elsewhere
export CLAUDE_DESTRUCTIVE_CONFIRM_TS=$(date +%s)
```

Both must be set; `CLAUDE_DESTRUCTIVE_CONFIRM_TS` must be within the last
`CLAUDE_DESTRUCTIVE_CONFIRM_TTL` seconds (default `600`) of the current
time — a stale token does not re-arm the gate. There is no way to disable
this check globally; it is per-command, per-confirmation. Setting the
token does not bypass the main-branch invariant itself (a delegated
worktree prefix is still required for HEAD-mutating verbs) — the two
checks are independent.

**Defense-in-depth mirror.** `.codex/rules/harness-destructive.rules`
mirrors the same verb list as `prefix_rule(...)` entries — Codex's `.rules`
/ `prefix_rule` mechanism is explicitly marked **experimental** by OpenAI
("Rules are experimental and may change"), so this file is a coarse
second layer, never the sole enforcement. `prefix_rule` can only match an
argv prefix — it cannot express "only when the target is `main`" or
"unless delegated to a registered worktree," so the `.rules` file forbids
the whole verb unconditionally while the hook admits the safe,
worktree-delegated forms. If `.codex/rules/` is ever removed, the hook
still enforces on its own.

**Maintenance-hook bypass escape hatches** (SessionStart hooks only —
these are housekeeping, never a security gate, so they degrade gracefully
when disabled):

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_DISABLE_WORKTREE_REAPER=1` or `CODEX_HARNESS_DISABLE_WORKTREE_REAPER=1` | Skip the worktree reaper for this session |
| `CLAUDE_DISABLE_LEARNING_GC=1` or `CODEX_HARNESS_DISABLE_LEARNING_GC=1` | Skip learning-log garbage collection for this session |

These bypass hatches do NOT apply to `main-branch-guard.sh` or the code
shape hooks — those are correctness/safety gates, not maintenance, and
have no blanket disable switch (only the narrow, per-command destructive-
verb confirmation-token protocol above).

## Code Shape Rules

Every code-touching session enforces continuously. The hook citations
below are presence-conditional, same caveat as § Non-LLM Gates on
Destructive Verbs — if `.codex/hooks/code-shape-check.sh` etc. are
absent from your tree, these are self-enforced discipline, not a
hook-backed guarantee.

- **Naming is the primary cohesion gate:** can't name a unit without "and"
  → split; can't give an extract an honest name → do NOT extract.
- **Per-language hard block on new/changed code:** Ruby methods > 5 lines
  blocked (exit 2); TypeScript/JS functions > 12 lines blocked; Python/Go
  fallback cap retained. Legacy code is advisory only. Enforced by
  `.codex/hooks/code-shape-check.sh` and `function-body-check.sh`
  (`PostToolUse:Write|Edit`, Phase 5, CX-51).
- **One thing per function.** If you cannot name it without a conjunction
  ("X and Y"), split.
- **Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 5.** Nesting ≤ 2 — guard clauses or extraction,
  not deeper if/else.
- **DRY on 2nd occurrence.** Extract immediately when logic recurs.
- **≤ 4 params** per function. More signals a missing abstraction.
- **Single public entry point** per class (`.call`/`.run`/`.execute`).
- **Entanglement escape valve:** if understanding unit A requires reading
  unit B, bring them together — this is HOW to fix a flagged function, not
  a bypass.
- **Comments carry WHY only.** New/changed WHAT-comments in source are
  blocked (exit 2) by `.codex/hooks/comment-smell-check.sh`; doc-comments,
  license headers, and `# WHY:`/`# SAFETY:` prefixes are always allowed.
- **Don't complect** (Hickey): one concern per unit; complected code defeats
  reasoning and breaks reliability.
- **Classes/files:** one responsibility, no hard size number — size is a
  smell that triggers the naming check. Safety-net cap:
  `CODEX_HARNESS_FILE_LINE_LIMIT` (default 300). Per-glob overrides via a
  `shape-overrides.json` still apply, same mechanism as the source harness's
  `.claude/shape-overrides.json`, retargeted to this repo's config surface.

Full standards (naming, SOLID, error handling, dependency resolution,
security baseline, test mix) are not yet ported into this repo verbatim;
until they are, treat the source harness's `protocols/engineering-invariants.md`
as authoritative and this section's list as the binding subset.

## Worktree + Commit Protocol

- **All build/fix/refactor work happens in a git worktree** (`git worktree
  add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b <branch>`), never directly against the checkout
  you started the session in. There is no per-agent isolation field to set
  — you create the worktree yourself, explicitly, before writing any code.
- **You commit before wrapping up** — uncommitted work cannot be handed
  back or merged. WIP commits use a `WIP:` prefix.
- **No `git add -A` / `git add .`** — stage specific files to avoid
  sensitive-file leakage.
- **REPO_ROOT HEAD stays on `main` for the entire duration of every
  session's work.** All HEAD-mutating git commands run via worktree
  delegation (`git -C "$WORKTREE" …` or `(cd "$WORKTREE" && …)`). Bare
  `git checkout`/`switch`/`reset --hard`/`merge`/`rebase`/`gh pr create` are
  blocked by `main-branch-guard.sh` (see Iron Law 4 and § Non-LLM Gates on
  Destructive Verbs, above).
- **Resource bounds.** `.codex/hooks/worktree-reaper.sh` reaps orphaned
  worktrees at `SessionStart` under the safety contract in § Non-LLM Gates
  on Destructive Verbs — a worktree is removed ONLY when its branch is
  merged into `main`, has zero uncommitted/untracked changes, and zero
  commits ahead of `main`.

## Working Discipline (single-thread, no phase gates)

There is no orchestrator here driving a phase-verdict state machine. A
session works one task vertically: TDD (RED before GREEN, per
`$harness-build-implementation`), the code shape rules above, then your
own `$harness-code-review` and `$harness-security-review` self-review
passes (either order — both are read-only checklists over the same diff,
run by you, not a separate reviewer), then verify/ship or hand back via
`HANDOFF.md`. "No phase skipped" (Iron Law 5) means you don't skip a step
in that sequence for yourself — there is no gate that would catch you if
you did.

## Runtime Model

Codex is a fallback **contractor**: it picks up work when the Claude
harness's usage window runs out, and hands work back when Claude returns.
Claude is primary and does the vast majority of pipeline work; Codex is
invoked only for shift coverage. This narrows the port's goal
considerably from an independent orchestration layer to a **shared
runtime state + handoff kit**:

**Shared `HARNESS_DATA` root.** Both harnesses point at ONE data root,
`${HARNESS_DATA:-$HOME/.claude}` — the SAME directory the Claude harness
uses for `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, not a separate `$CODEX_HOME/harness-data`
tree. `pipeline-state/`, the learning observations log, and any other
runtime state are the same files on disk for whichever side is on shift —
one copy of truth, no sync job, no drift to reconcile. Every native hook
in `.codex/hooks/` resolves state against this shared root via
`.codex/hooks/_lib/harness-paths.sh` (`HARNESS_DATA` for runtime state,
`HARNESS_ROOT` for reusing the Claude-side code install where a hook
delegates rather than reimplements — see `learning-gc.sh` in § Non-LLM
Gates on Destructive Verbs, above), never a repo-local copy.

**The handoff coordination surface.** A `HANDOFF.md` contract plus an
`ACTIVE_HARNESS` baton file (both fully specified in
`pipeline-state/HANDOFF-CONTRACT.md`) coordinate the shift change:

- `$HARNESS_DATA/ACTIVE_HARNESS` — single line, `<claude|codex>
  <ISO 8601>`, naming which harness currently holds the baton. Advisory
  (a warn, not a hard block) — a stale baton from a crashed session must
  not permanently lock the other harness out.
- `$HARNESS_DATA/pipeline-state/{task-id}/HANDOFF.md` — additive prose
  context (Done / In Flight / Next Actions / Landmines), NOT the source of
  truth. `pipeline-state/{task-id}/pipeline.md` remains the
  machine-readable truth for phase/verdict state. Whoever picks up a
  `HANDOFF.md` MUST reconcile it against git ground truth before trusting
  it (branch exists, worktree exists or gets re-created, tests actually
  pass as claimed) — on any conflict, git and test reality win over prose.

**Picking up work**: run `$harness-resume-handoff` — see
`.agents/skills/harness-resume-handoff/SKILL.md` for the full procedure
(check the baton, find the handed-off `HANDOFF.md`, reconcile against git,
continue `Next Actions` vertically, capture a `source: codex` observation,
wrap with a return `HANDOFF.md` and a baton flip back to `claude`). Codex
has no subagent/worktree dispatch equivalent to the Claude harness's
parallel-subagent default — every step runs in this single session.

This preserves the same seed-vs-runtime split the Claude harness already
uses: this repo ships only curated seed (skills, hooks, rules, config);
runtime state (`pipeline-state/`, the learning log, metrics) is never
committed back to this repo, regardless of which harness wrote it.

## Sandbox / Permission Posture

`codex exec` defaults to **read-only**. Explicitly request `workspace-write`
for any session that will edit files. `danger-full-access` is never used
outside a documented, isolated runner — treat any invocation requesting it
as a stop-and-report event, same posture as this harness applies to
bypassing a blocked gate (see Iron Law 8, above).

## Definition of Done

A unit of work is done when ALL of the following hold:

- Every acceptance criterion is covered by a failing-then-passing test in
  the diff (Iron Law 1).
- Your own `$harness-code-review` and `$harness-security-review` passes
  both reach APPROVE.
- The pull request is merged (or, for a mid-shift handoff, a return
  `HANDOFF.md` is written and the baton is flipped back to `claude`).
- An observation has been appended to the shared learning log with
  `"source": "codex"` (Iron Law 7) — no exceptions, successes and
  failures both.
